"Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages in a way that is both valuable and meaningful. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning models to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data."
